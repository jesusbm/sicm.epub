<p>We would like to thank the many people who have helped us to develop
this book and the curriculum it is designed to support.  We have
had substantial help from the wonderful students who studied with us
in our classical mechanics class.  They have forced us to be clear;
they have found bugs that we had to fix in the software, in the
presentation, and in our thinking.</p>
<p>
We have had considerable technical help in the development and
presentation of the subject matter from Harold Abelson.  Abelson is
one of the developers of the Scmutils software system.  He put mighty
effort into some sections of the code.  We also consulted him when we
were desperately trying to understand the logic of mechanics.  He
often could propose a direction to lead out of an intellectual maze.</p>
<p>
Matthew Halfant started us on the development of the Scmutils system.
He encouraged us to get into scientific computation, using Scheme and
functional style as an active way to explain the ideas, without the
distractions of imperative languages such as C.  In the 1980s he
wrote some of the early Scheme procedures for numerical computation
that we still use.</p>
<p>
Dan Zuras helped us with the invention of the unique organization of
the Scmutils system.  It is because of his insight that the system is
organized around a generic extension of the chain rule for taking
derivatives.  He also helped in the heavy lifting that was required to
make a really good polynomial GCD algorithm, based on ideas we
learned from Richard Zippel.</p>
<p>
This book, and a great deal of other work of our laboratory, could not
have been done without the outstanding work of Chris Hanson.  Chris
developed and maintained the Scheme system underlying this work.  In
addition, he took us through a pass of reorganization of the Scmutils
system that forced the clarification of many of the ideas of types and
of generic operations that make our system as good as it is.</p>
<p>
Guillermo Juan Rozas, co-developer of the Scheme system, made major
contributions to the Scheme compiler, and implemented a number of
other arcane mechanisms that make our system efficient enough to
support our work.</p>
<p>
Besides contributing to some of the methods for the solution of linear
equations in the Scmutils system, Jacob Katzenelson has provided
valuable feedback that improved the presentation of the material.</p>
<p>
Julie Sussman, PPA, provided careful reading and serious criticism
that forced us to reorganize and rewrite major parts of the text.  She
also developed and maintained Gerald Jay Sussman over these many years.</p>
<p>
Cecile Wisdom, saint, is a constant reminder, by her faith and
example, of what is really important.  This project would not have
been possible without the loving support and unfailing encouragement
she has given Jack Wisdom.  Their children, William, Edward, Thomas,
John, and Elizabeth Wisdom, daily enrich his life with theirs.</p>
<p>
Meinhard (Hardy) Mayer wants to thank Rita Mayer for patient moral
support, particularly during his frequent visits to MIT during the
last 12 years, Niels Mayer for introducing him to the wonderful
world of Scheme (thus sowing the seeds for this collaboration), as
well as Elma and the rest of the family for their love.</p>
<p>
Many have contributed to our understanding of dynamics over the years.
Boris Chirikov, Michel H&eacute;non, Peter Goldreich, and Stan Peale have
had particular influence.  We also acknowledge the influence of the
late Res Jost.</p>
<p>
Numerous others have contributed to this work, either in the
development of the software or in the development of the content,
including Bill Siebert, Panayotis Skordos, Kleanthes Koniaris, Kevin
Lin, James McBride, Rebecca Frankel, Thomas F. Knight, Pawan Kumar,
Elizabeth Bradley, Alice Seckel, Jihad Touma, and Kenneth Yip.  We
have had extremely useful feedback from and discussions with Piet Hut,
Jon Doyle, David Finkelstein, Peter Fisher, Guy Lewis Steele Jr., and
Robert Hermann.</p>
<p>
We thank the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for its
hospitality and logistical support.  We acknowledge the Matsushita
Corporation for support of Gerald Jay Sussman through an endowed
chair.  We thank Breene M. Kerr for support of Jack Wisdom
through an endowed chair.  We thank the MIT Mathematics and EECS
departments for sabbatical support for Meinhard Mayer.  </p>
<p>
We also want to thank Katrina Avery, our copy editor, for her help in
the preparation of this book.  And, finally, we are grateful to
Rebecca Bisbee for her assistance over the many years we have been
involved in this project.
