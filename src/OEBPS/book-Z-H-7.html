The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their
position in space with ``time.''  I should load my conscience with
grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate
the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and
detailed explanations.  Let us proceed to disclose these sins.</p>

The subject of this book is motion and the mathematical tools used to
describe it.</p>
<p>
Centuries of careful observations of the motions of the planets
revealed regularities in those motions, allowing accurate predictions
of phenomena such as eclipses and conjunctions.  The effort to
formulate these regularities and ultimately to understand them led to
the development of mathematics and to the discovery that mathematics
could be effectively used to describe aspects of the physical world.
That mathematics can be used to describe natural phenomena is a
remarkable fact.</p>
<p>
A pin thrown by a juggler takes a rather predictable path and
rotates in a rather predictable way.  In fact, the skill of
juggling depends crucially on this predictability.  It
is also a remarkable discovery that the same mathematical tools used
to describe the motions of the planets can be used to describe the
motion of the juggling pin.</p>
<p>
Classical mechanics describes the motion of a system of particles,
subject to forces describing their interactions.  Complex physical
objects, such as juggling pins, can be modeled as myriad particles
with fixed spatial relationships maintained by stiff forces of
interaction.</p>
<p>
There are many conceivable ways a system could move that never occur.
We can imagine that the juggling pin might pause in midair or go
fourteen times around the head of the juggler before being caught, but
these motions do not happen.  How can we distinguish motions of a
system that can actually occur from other conceivable motions?
Perhaps we can invent some mathematical <a name="%_idx_40"></a>function that allows us to
distinguish <a name="%_idx_42"></a>realizable motions from among all conceivable motions.</p>
<p>
The motion of a system can be described by giving the position of
every piece of the system at each moment.  Such a description of the
motion of the system is called a <a name="%_idx_44"></a><em>configuration path</em>; the
configuration path specifies the configuration as a function of time.
The juggling pin rotates as it flies through the air; the
configuration of the juggling pin is specified by giving the position
and orientation of the pin.  The motion of the juggling pin is
specified by giving the position and orientation of the pin as a
function of time.</p>
<p>
The function that we seek takes a configuration path as an input and
produces some output.  We want this function to have
some characteristic behavior when the input is a realizable path.
For example, the output could be a number, and we could try to arrange
that this number be zero only on realizable paths.  Newton's equations
of motion are of this form; at each moment Newton's differential
equations must be satisfied.</p>
<p>
However, there is an alternate strategy that provides more insight and
power: we could look for a path-distinguishing function that has
a minimum on the realizable paths -- on nearby unrealizable paths the
value of the function is higher than it is on the realizable path.
This is the <a name="%_idx_46"></a><em>variational strategy</em>: for each physical system we invent a
path-distinguishing function that distinguishes realizable motions of
the system by having a stationary point for each realizable path.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_8" href="book-Z-H-7.html#footnote_Temp_8"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>
For a great variety of systems
realizable motions of the system can be formulated in terms of a
variational principle.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_9" href="book-Z-H-7.html#footnote_Temp_9"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> </p>
<p>
Mechanics, as invented by <a name="%_idx_50"></a>Newton and others of his era, describes the
motion of a system in terms of the positions, velocities, and accelerations of
each of the particles in the system.  In contrast to the <a name="%_idx_52"></a><a name="%_idx_54"></a>Newtonian
formulation of mechanics, the variational formulation of mechanics
describes the motion of a system in terms of aggregate quantities that
are associated with the motion of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>
In the Newtonian formulation the forces can often be written as
derivatives of the potential energy of the system.  The motion of the
system is determined by considering how the individual component
particles respond to these forces.  The Newtonian formulation of the
equations of motion is intrinsically a particle-by-particle
description.</p>
<p>
In the variational formulation the equations of motion are formulated
in terms of the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential
energy.  The potential energy is a number that is characteristic of
the arrangement of the particles in the system; the kinetic energy is
a number that is determined by the velocities of the particles in the
system. Neither the potential energy nor the kinetic energy depends on
how those positions and velocities are specified.  The difference is
characteristic of the system as a whole and does not depend on the
details of how the system is specified.  So we are free to choose ways
of describing the system that are easy to work with; we are liberated
from the particle-by-particle description inherent in the Newtonian
formulation.</p>
<p>
The variational formulation has numerous advantages over the Newtonian
formulation.  The equations of motion for those parameters that
describe the state of the system are derived in the same way
regardless of the choice of those parameters: the method of
formulation does not depend on the choice of <a name="%_idx_56"></a>coordinate system.  If
there are positional constraints among the particles of a system the
Newtonian formulation requires that we consider the forces maintaining
these constraints, whereas in the variational formulation the
constraints can be built into the coordinates.  The variational
formulation reveals the association of conservation laws with
symmetries.  The variational formulation provides a framework for
placing any particular motion of a system in the context of all
possible motions of the system.  We pursue the variational
formulation because of these advantages.</p>

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_8" href="book-Z-H-7.html#call_footnote_Temp_8"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> A <em>stationary point</em> of a function is a point where the
<a name="%_idx_48"></a>  function's value does not vary as the input is varied.  Local maxima
or minima are stationary points.</p>

<p><a name="footnote_Temp_9" href="book-Z-H-7.html#call_footnote_Temp_9"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> The variational formulation successfully describes 
all of the Newtonian
mechanics of particles and rigid bodies.  The variational formulation
has also been usefully applied in the description of many other
systems such as classical electrodynamics, the dynamics of inviscid
fluids, and the design of mechanisms such as four-bar linkages.  In
addition, modern formulations of quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory build on many of the same concepts.  
However, it appears that not all dynamical systems have a variational
formulation.
For example, there is no simple prescription to apply the
variational apparatus to systems with dissipation, though in special
cases variational methods can still be used.</p>
