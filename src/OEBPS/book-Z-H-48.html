When we try to represent the figure formed by these two curves and
their intersections in a finite number, each of which corresponds to a
doubly asymptotic solution, these intersections form a type of
trellis, tissue, or grid with infinitely serrated mesh.  Neither of
these two curves must ever cut across itself again, but it must bend
back upon itself in a very complex manner in order to cut across all
of the meshes in the grid an infinite number of times.
The complexity of this figure will be striking, and I shall not even
try to draw it.</p>

<a name="%_idx_2134"></a>We have seen rather complicated features appear as part of the
Poincar&eacute; sections of a variety of systems.  We have seen fixed
points, invariant curves, resonance islands, and chaotic zones in 
systems as diverse as the driven pendulum, the non-axisymmetric top, the
H&eacute;non-Heiles system, and the spin-orbit coupling of a satellite.
Indeed, even in the standard map, where there is no continuous process
sampled by the surface of section, the phase space shows similar
features.</p>
<p>
The motion of other systems is simpler.  For some systems conserved
quantities can be used to reduce the solution to the evaluation of
definite integrals.  An example is the axisymmetric top.  Two
symmetries imply the existence of two conserved momenta, and time
independence of the Hamiltonian implies energy conservation.  With
these conserved quantities, determining the motion is reduced to the
evaluation of definite integrals of the periodic motion of the tilt
angle as a function of time.  Such systems do not exhibit chaotic
behavior; on a surface of section the conserved quantities constrain
the points to fall on curves.  We may conjecture that if points on a
surface of section do not apparently fall on curves then not enough
conserved quantities exist to reduce the solution to
quadratures.</p>
<p>
We have seen a number of instances in which the behavior of a system
changes qualitatively with the inclusion of additional effects.  The free rigid
body can be reduced to quadratures, but the addition of gravity-gradient
torques in the spin-orbit system yields the familiar mixture
of regular and chaotic motions.  The motion of an axisymmetric top is
also reducible to quadratures, but if the top is made non-axisymmetric
then the divided phase space appears.  The system studied by H&eacute;non and
Heiles, with the classic divided phase space, can be thought of as a
solvable pair of harmonic oscillators with nonlinear coupling terms.
The pendulum is solvable, but the driven pendulum has the divided phase
space.</p>
<p>
We observe that, as additional effects are turned on, qualitative
changes occur in the phase space.  Resonance islands appear, chaotic
zones appear, some invariant curves disappear, but others persist.
Why do resonance islands appear?  How does chaotic behavior arise?
When do invariant curves persist?  Can we draw any general
conclusions?</p>
