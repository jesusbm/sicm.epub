We have done considerable mountain climbing.  Now we are in the
rarefied atmosphere of theories of excessive beauty and we are nearing
a high plateau on which geometry, optics, mechanics, and wave
mechanics meet on common ground.  Only concentrated thinking, and a
considerable amount of re-creation, will reveal the beauty of our
subject in which the last word has not been spoken.</p>

<a name="%_idx_2448"></a>One way to simplify the analysis of a problem is to express it in a
form in which the solution has a simple representation.  However, it
may not be easy to formulate the problem in such a way initially.  It
is often useful to start by formulating the problem in one way, and
then transform it.
For example, the formulation of the problem
of the motion of a number of gravitating bodies is simple in
rectangular coordinates, but it is easier to understand aspects of the
motion in terms of orbital elements, such as the semimajor axes,
eccentricities, and inclinations of the orbits.  The semimajor axis
and eccentricity of an orbit depend on both the configuration and the
velocity of the body.  Such transformations are more general than
those that express changes in configuration coordinates.  Here we
investigate transformations of phase-space coordinates that involve
both the generalized coordinates and the generalized momenta.</p>
<p>
Suppose we have two different Hamiltonian systems, and suppose the
trajectories of the two systems are in one-to-one correspondence.  In
this case both Hamiltonian systems can be mathematical models of the
same physical system.  Some questions about the physical system may be
easier to answer by reference to one model and others may be easier to
answer in the other model.  For example, it may be easier to formulate
the physical system in one model and to discover a conserved quantity
in the other.  Canonical transformations are maps between Hamiltonian
systems that preserve the dynamics.</p>
<p>
A <em>canonical transformation</em> is a phase-space coordinate
transformation and an associated transformation of the Hamiltonian
such that the dynamics given by Hamilton's equations in the two
representations describe the same evolution of the system.</p>
