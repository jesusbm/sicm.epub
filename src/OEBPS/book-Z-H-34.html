<p>A rigid body is an example of a mechanical system with constraints.
Thus, in a sense this chapter on rigid bodies was nothing but an
extended example of the application of the ideas developed in the
first chapter.  The equations of motion are just the Lagrange
equations.</p>
<p>
The kinetic energy for a rigid body separates
into a translational kinetic energy and a rotational kinetic energy.
The center of mass plays a special role in this separation.
The rotational kinetic energy is simply expressed in terms of the
inertia tensor and the angular velocity vector.
We developed the expressions for the kinetic energy that take into
account the body constraints, and we expressed the remaining degrees
of freedom in terms of suitable generalized coordinates.</p>
<p>
The vector angular momentum is conserved if there are no external
torques.  The time derivative of the body components of the angular
momentum can be written entirely in terms of the body components of
the angular momentum, and the three principal moments of inertia.  The
body components of angular momentum form a self-contained dynamical
subsystem.</p>
<p>
One choice for generalized coordinates is the Euler angles.  They form
suitable generalized coordinates, but are otherwise not special or
well motivated.
The Lagrange equations for the Euler angles are singular for some
Euler angles.  Other choices of generalized coordinates like the Euler
angles have similar problems.  Equations of motion for the orientation
vector are nonsingular.</p>
<p>
In general the potential energy depends on the details of the mass
distribution, and does not separate as the kinetic energy separated
into center of mass and relative contributions.</p>
<p>
For an axisymmetric top with uniform gravitational acceleration, the
potential energy is exactly the potential energy due to elevation of
the center of mass.  Aspects of the motion of the top are deduced from
the conserved quantities.  Euler angles are just the right thing for
this problem.</p>
<p>
For other problems, such as the rotational motion of an out-of-round
satellite near a planet, the potential energy cannot be written in
finite terms, and judicious approximations must be made.  The
essential character of such diverse systems as the rotation of the
Moon, Hyperion, and Mercury are captured by a simple model problem.</p>
