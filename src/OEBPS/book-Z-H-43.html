<h2><a href="book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_%_sec_3.7">3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Exponential Divergence</a></h2>
<p><a name="%_idx_2012"></a>
H&eacute;non and Heiles discovered that the chaotic trajectories had
<a name="%_idx_2014"></a>remarkable sensitivity to small changes in initial
conditions -- initially nearby chaotic trajectories separate roughly
exponentially with time.  On the other hand, regular trajectories do
not exhibit this sensitivity -- initially nearby <a name="%_idx_2016"></a><a name="%_idx_2018"></a>regular trajectories
separate roughly linearly with time.</p>
<p>
Consider the evolution of two initially nearby trajectories for the
H&eacute;non-Heiles problem, with energy <em>E</em> = 1/8.  Let
<em>d</em>(<em>t</em>) be the usual Euclidean distance in the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>p</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>, <em>p</em><sub><em>y</em></sub> space 
between the two trajectories at time <em>t</em>.  Figure&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-43.html#FIGURE_3.23">3.23</a> shows the common
logarithm of <em>d</em>(<em>t</em>)/<em>d</em>(0) as a function of time <em>t</em>.  We see that the
divergence is well described as exponential.

<p></p>
<p>
On the other hand, the distance between two initially nearby regular
trajectories grows much more slowly.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-43.html#FIGURE_3.24">3.24</a> shows the distance between two regular
trajectories as a function of time.  The distance grows linearly with time.

<p></p>
<p>
It is remarkable that Hamiltonian systems have such radically
different types of trajectories.  On the surface of section the
chaotic and regular trajectories differ in the dimension of the space
that they explore.  It is
interesting that along with this dimensional difference there is a
drastic difference in the way chaotic and regular trajectories
separate.  For higher dimensional systems the surface of section technique is
not as useful, but trajectories are still distinguished by the way
neighboring trajectories diverge: some diverge exponentially whereas
others diverge approximately linearly.  Exponential divergence is the
hallmark of chaotic behavior.</p>
<p>

The rate of exponential divergence is quantified by the slope of the
graph of log(<em>d</em>(<em>t</em>)/<em>d</em>(0)).  We can estimate the rate of exponential
divergence of trajectories from a particular phase-space trajectory
<img src="chap3-Z-G-D-5.gif" border="0"> by choosing a nearby trajectory <img src="chap3-Z-G-D-5.gif" border="0">' and computing
<a name="EQUATION_3.140"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap3-Z-G-160.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
where <em>d</em>(<em>t</em>)  =  || <img src="chap3-Z-G-D-5.gif" border="0">'(<em>t</em>)  <tt>-</tt>  <img src="chap3-Z-G-D-5.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>) ||.
<a name="%_idx_2020"></a>A problem with this ``two-trajectory'' method is
illustrated in figure&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-43.html#FIGURE_3.23">3.23</a>.  For strongly chaotic
trajectories two initially nearby trajectories soon find themselves as
far apart as they can get.  Once this happens the distance no longer
grows.  The estimate of the rate of divergence of trajectories is
limited by this ``saturation.''</p>
<p>

We can improve on this method by studying a variational system of
equations.  Let 
<a name="EQUATION_3.141"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap3-Z-G-161.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
be the system of equations governing the evolution of the system.
A nearby trajectory <em>z</em>' satisfies
<a name="EQUATION_3.142"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap3-Z-G-162.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
The difference <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">  =  <em>z</em>'  <tt>-</tt>  <em>z</em> between these trajectories satisfies
<a name="EQUATION_3.143"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap3-Z-G-163.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
If <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0"> is small we can approximate the right-hand side by a derivative
<a name="EQUATION_3.144"></a></p>
<div align=left><img src="chap3-Z-G-164.gif" border="0"></div>
<p>
This set of ordinary differential equations is called the <a name="%_idx_2022"></a><em>variational
equations</em> for the system.  It is linear in <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0"> and driven by <em>z</em>.</p>
<p>

Let <em>d</em>(<em>t</em>)  =  || <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>) ||; then the rate of divergence can be estimated
as before.  The advantage of this ``variational method'' is that <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>)
can become arbitrarily large and its growth still measures the
divergence of nearby trajectories.  We can see in
figure&nbsp;<a href="book-Z-H-43.html#FIGURE_3.23">3.23</a> that the variational method gives
nearly the same result as the two-trajectory method up to the point at
which the two-trajectory method saturates.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_276" href="book-Z-H-43.html#footnote_Temp_276"><sup><small>30</small></sup></a></p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_2026"></a>The <em>Lyapunov exponent</em> is defined to be the infinite time limit of <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-1.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>),
defined by equation&nbsp;(<a href="book-Z-H-43.html#EQUATION_3.140">3.140</a>), in which the
distance <em>d</em> is computed by the variational method.  Actually, for each
trajectory there are many Lyapunov exponents, depending on the initial
direction of the variation <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">.  For an <em>N</em>-dimensional system,
there are <em>N</em>&nbsp;Lyapunov exponents.  For a randomly chosen <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>),
the subsequent growth of <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>) has components that grow with each of
the Lyapunov exponents.  In general, however, the growth of <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>) will
be dominated by the largest exponent.  The largest Lyapunov exponent
thus can be interpreted as the typical rate of <a name="%_idx_2028"></a>exponential
divergence of nearby trajectories.  The sum of the largest two
Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted as the typical rate of growth of
the area of two-dimensional elements.  This interpretation can be extended to 
higher-dimensional elements: the rate of growth of volume elements is the
sum of all the Lyapunov exponents.</p>
<p>
<a name="%_idx_2030"></a><a name="%_idx_2032"></a>In Hamiltonian systems, the Lyapunov
exponents must satisfy constraints, which we will justify later.  Lyapunov
exponents come in pairs: for every Lyapunov exponent <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> its
negation  <tt>-</tt> <img src="chap1-Z-G-D-40.gif" border="0"> is also an exponent.  For every conserved
quantity, one of the Lyapunov exponents is zero, as is its negation.
So the Lyapunov exponents can be used to check for the existence of
conserved quantities.  The sum of the Lyapunov exponents for a
Hamiltonian system is zero, so volume elements do not grow exponentially.
We will see in the next section that phase-space volume is
actually conserved for Hamiltonian systems.</p>

we can replace <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0"> by <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">/<em>c</em> whenever <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0">(<em>t</em>) becomes
uncomfortably large.  The equation governing <img src="chap2-Z-G-D-10.gif" border="0"> is linear, so except
for the scale change, the evolution is unchanged.  Of course we have
to keep track of these scale changes when computing the average growth
rate.  This process is called ``renormalization'' to make it sound 
impressive.</p>
